## About Me

I am a Undergraduate student at CUHK(SZ), School of Science and Engineering, Dilligential College, major in Computer Engineering.  
Thanks to Ph.D candidate LIU, I'm now doing research in AIRS Lab on campus, mainly focus on the **UAV**(Unmanned Aerial Vehicle).  
Thanks to associate research fellow LIU in ICT, CAS, I'm also getting into the field of **DSA**(Domain Specific Architecture).  

## Research Interests

- **UAV** control algorithm, landing system, trajectory optimization
- **DSA** SFQ-based integrated circuit design&simulation
